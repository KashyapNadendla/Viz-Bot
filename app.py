# Brief Explanation
st.write("""
Data the Explorer is an interactive application tailored for comprehensive data exploration, EDA, and machine learning model evaluation. Users can upload datasets to perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), build and run ML models, and receive interpretations of model results. Enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs), the app provides AI-driven recommendations on visualizations, feature engineering, and model choices, making data analysis more insightful and accessible.
